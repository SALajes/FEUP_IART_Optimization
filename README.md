# IART

## Compile and Run
 Since the project was built in Python, the only requirement for running with the command line is having python3 installed in the OS - it is already built in Linux (or run in IDEs with Python extensions).

 Compiling is not needed with Python, to run the application one must type: python3 main.py <<file_path>>
